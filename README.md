Algorithm Implementations in C++
This repository contains the C++ implementations of fundamental searching and sorting algorithms. These are designed for educational purposes, helping beginners understand the core logic of commonly used algorithms.

Algorithms Included
1. Binary Search
File: Binary_search_algorithm.cpp

Description: Efficient searching algorithm that works on sorted arrays by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half.

Time Complexity: O(log n)

2. Interpolation Search
File: Interpolation_algorithm.cpp

Description: An improved variant of binary search, best suited for uniformly distributed data. It estimates the position of the target value using interpolation.

Time Complexity:

Average: O(log log n)

Worst: O(n)

3. Merge Sort
File: Merge_sort_algorithm.cpp

Description: A divide and conquer sorting algorithm that splits the array into halves, recursively sorts them, and merges the sorted halves.

Time Complexity: O(n log n)

4. Selection Sort
File: Selection_sort_algorithm.cpp

Description: A simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly selects the minimum element and places it at the correct position.

Time Complexity: O(nÂ²)

Purpose
Practice and understanding of classic searching and sorting algorithms
